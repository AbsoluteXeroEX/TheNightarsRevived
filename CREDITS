The Nightars (Revived) Mod

Author: Seth Boyce (AbsoluteXero/AbsoluteXeroEX)

The majority of the content presented herein was originally created by Starbound Community user, iMisterX. This mod is now being continued by the author listed above, and has been partially integrated into Frackin' Universe. Any assets present may be used with or without permission; although no notice of derivative use is required, please ensure that any similar item names (JSON: "[item/object/material]Name") are changed so as not to conflict with these assets. Because of the previously-noted merging of assets into Frackin' Universe, this mod has ceased compatibility with it.

Any updates to the mod will be made publicly available with detail as they are pushed. Any issues should be brought to AbsoluteXero (GitHub: AbsoluteXeroEX).
