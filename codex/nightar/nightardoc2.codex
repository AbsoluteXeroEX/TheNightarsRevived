    "Like many other civilizations, the Nightars went through their own 'primitive' eras. For them, their last primitive era was close to around 4,000 years ago, leading into their Imperial era some thousand years later. Their first known homeworld had typical metals found nearly anywhere in the universe, but there was a certain exotic element found only on planets of their homeworld's type.",

    "These 'dark fragments', as they have been called, gave rise to uniquely powerful weapons. Initially, they were very rare, and because of their usage in general melee weapons, this lead to a dynamic shift in their cultural paradigm; they believed that they and their weapons were eternally bound to each other.",

    "Some blades were passed from father to son for many generations, while others were buried along with their owners, as they had no worthy successors to pass them onto. This raised the question of grave-robbing, and became viewed as one of the most cowardly acts among the Nightars.",

    "While the Nightars are familiar with the practicality of firearms, their true potential lies in their martial abilities. Nightars have a preference for the sword, but are not completely opposed to some of the more 'smaller' ranged weapons such as sidearms, though even the prospect of just holding one is met with great hesitation."
