    "After a massive war of succession, much of the Nightar society was fractured into various smaller 'tribes', for lack of a better term. A few tribes remained on their origin world and still fight for absolute rule of that planet. Most of the other tribes all went their separate ways, and those that stayed within close enough range of each other each formed a pact, leading to the majority of leadership in the form of something similar to a thalassocracy where Nightar societies are more heavily concentrated within a system.",

    "Combat rites of eld are still (interestingly) practiced, even to this day amongst all Nightar colonies that are known, as they still believe in the old addage of 'live by the sword, die by the sword'. Their technology in particular has allowed them to master the shadows, and thus they remain bound to living in the darkness. "
