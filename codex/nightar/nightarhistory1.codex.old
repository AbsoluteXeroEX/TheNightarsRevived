    "These pages chronicle the history of the Nightars, as best as we can remember.

    We do not remember much our origins; where we come from, who the first generation was, our connection to the primal essence of midnight, all of these topics' histories elude us. What we know for certain is that at some point in the lineage of the royal family, the king at the time was called Quintus sig Celsus, and the Nightars prospered under his reign.",

    "When he passed, his first-born, Quintus sig Celsus II assumed the throne, and we entered into a new era of technological advancement. Within two generations, we had the capability of exploring beyond our primary star, and created settlements that were completely autonomous. The king had no qualms about this, and allowed them to live peacefully apart from the kingdom.",

    "However, the cliche` of 'peace was not everlasting' reared its head. King Celsus II did not believe that the kingdom was for one family alone to rule, and he sought out a successor outside of the royal family. There were dissidents in service to the king who voiced their concerns over this, as the rigid monarchal structure had been in place for generations, but King Celsus II would have none of it.",

    "A vile plot was then enacted to unseat him and establish a new royal family; this marked the beginning of our first civil war, and pitted brother against sister, father against son, and mother against daughter. For decades after, our legacy would be marred by bloodshed. Many of us fled and sought out less-cultivated planets and built our dwellings underground. We were safe for a time."
