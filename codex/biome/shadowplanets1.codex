    "We set up a small outpost on one of the planets orbiting the black star we discovered. These places are quite harsh; the wildlife appear as specters, almost invisible to the naked eye. Contending with these creatures is quite the task, and the lack of natural light makes it that much harder to explore and collect samples. We've managed to collect enough for study, and we've made an astonishing find.",

    "The formations of the ground are natural, with hills and flats as you would expect to see on a non-colonized planet. When analyzing the soil with our spectral analyzers, we noticed some extra matter in its composition. This extra matter we found makes it so that it ^orange;absorbs^reset; light when exposed to it. Holding it in your hand and looking at it under a bright light makes it appear as a black nothingness with no discernable details.",

    "Understanding this has proved to be troublesome. Aside from the sight of it, you wouldn't be able to tell if this soil was from a natural planet or if it were from one of these dark planets. Command is eager to continue research on these planets, and have sent more researchers, as well as security forces to help deal with the wildlife we encounter. This is a great day for us."
