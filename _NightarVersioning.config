^cyan;The Nightars (Revived)^reset;
The Nightars are something of a legacy race that has been around for quite some time, given birth by ^green;iMisterX^reset;, who graciously allowed me to continue working on it after he let go of it. While the race itself is now integrated into ^orange;Frackin' Universe^reset;, many changes from this version were not ported to it. Furthermore, this update branches into its own, vanilla-based aspect, and will likely cause issues with FU down the road, if it isn't already. I am working on a separate branch to maintain compatibility with FU, which I will gladly continue working with sayter on as it goes along, but as of this particular version update, it is recommended that you keep a copied version of your Starbound installation folder or use this mod with the Unstable version of Starbound (it works well enough). Aside from that, there shouldn't be much else in the way of compatibility issues.

I want to thank all of you who have downloaded this mod for your continued support, as well as special thanks to the Frackin' Universe team, zimberzimber, and iMisterX.",
