    "We were on a routine survey run. Once we reached out point of entry into the assigned system, we noticed a peculiar reading on our star map. It was a small spot of what seemed like completely empty space, however we noticed a gravitational pull surrounding it. It was almost as if it was a system that had been haphazardly erased from the database, but that wasn't the case.",

    "As we finished up our survey, we were preparing to head to our next destination, when one of our crew members suggested skimming by the coordinates on our star map of that strange star reading. Many of us were hesitant, but our captain decided we should note it in case we needed to submit a petition for updating the galactic database. We would have to pass by it on our way to our next stop anyways.",

    "The deep, black void of space can be terrifying, particularly when there is no light. Such was our shared feelings of dread when we entered into the boundaries of this black star. We sent our telemetry on the system to our researchers, and they were nearly driven mad trying to make heads or tails of it. According to what one of them said, this star is simultaneously dead and alive. Not in the biological sense, mind. It bears no light, yet it still generates just enough heat to sustain life on the surrounding planets, which are equally as dark as the star itself.",

    "This is an anomaly if ever there was one. For all intents and purposes, it is scientifically impossible for this star to exist. And even more peculiar is that once we had S.A.I.L. process the telemetry we collected to update our personal star map database, we noticed that throughout every single quadrant, there were more of these instances lightly seeded throughout the entire known map. They are extremely small in number compared to the common star types, but command has decided that it warrants an investigation."
