Thank you for downloading this version of The Nightars race mod! This version branches off into its own, vanilla-based branch, and sadly is no longer compatible with Frackin' Universe (Sayter has integrated the Nightars into FU, and I am working with him on getting the assets up to date).

In regarads to research, it works a bit differently than the FU counterpart. Rather than having stations to generate research, special items can be found and traded for research notes or used as-is, depending on the node you want to unlock. Some nodes, such as advanced ores, requires a requisite amount of the respective ores to unlock their 'refined versions'. Many blueprints are hidden in the research tree intentionally, due to space constraints. If there's an issue, say you unlock a node and you get blueprints for 'Perfectly Generic Item', please let me know on the GitHub issue tracking page, as I'll be more apt (and readily able) to respond there.

^orange;-- This mod was thoroughly tested with both the stable and unstable versions of Starbound. --",
