  "description" : "The Nightar Race, originally created by the incredibly talented iMisterX, revived and brought back with some minor updates! I talked briefly with the original author, and they agreed to let me continue working on this mod. Once I get the advanced modding aspects down, I'll be adding more dynamic, Nightar-centric content. Stay posted!\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST have a character creation extension mod in order to use additional races outside of Starbound's default set. I personally use Kawa's Xbawks Character Extension mod, which can be found in the link below:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=729426722&searchtext=xbawks",
