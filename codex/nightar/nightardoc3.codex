  "The Nightars are similiar to humans in the way they live, except that most of them are knights, assassins, fighters, etc. They have cold personalities and are not as social as humans are. Some of them prefer living in castles with their kind, and others prefer living all alone, isolated in deserted places since socializing is not really important for them."
