# Instructions

# Important:
**This mod is no longer compatible with Frackin' Universe.**

The Frackin' Universe team has integrated the assets of the Nightars into their mod, and therefore is no longer compatible due to duplicate items. This mod should work just fine otherwise. I will continue to provide support for FU's Nightar assets, but many assets from this mod will not be included for FU usage due to the individual natures of both this mod and Frackin' Universe. If you encounter any issues, please open a request on the repository, as I will most easily be able to track ongoing issues there.
