  "One last thing worthy of mentioning is, the nightars technologies are all based on a sigle artifitial, a crystal, that was created by the first Nightar, Gin. That crystal, or as he named it, the Nightium crystal holds amazing properties. It has alot of stored energy, it doesn't lose it's energy unless it is used, it can be easily molded when heated, and it becomes solid and as hard as the hardest thing you can imagine when frozen, it is truly an amazing invention."
