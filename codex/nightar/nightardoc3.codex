    "While they thrive in it, Nightars can also fear the darkness. After all, they've had to contend with all manner of nocturnal denizens both above and below ground. Some of the most fearsome creatures live on the darkest of homeworlds where the Nightars make their stay, and legends tell of one particularly terrifying monster from the first of their worlds.",

    "These creatures were said to have preyed on strong and weak alike, seemingly mocking the Nightars for trying to claim their spot as the top of the nocturnal food chain. A name for it was never revealed, but many planets have their own terrifying monstrosities, so we can't easily shrug these accounts off as simple hearsay."
