    "No one remembers who exactly the first Nightars were; hardly any of them remember their origins at all. Time whisked away their oldest memories. It is likely that they are an evolution of humans, since they share an overall, nearly identical appearance with them.",

    "The oldest known construction was a massive, planet-wide city that expanded mostly underground. This didn't stop them from completely living on the surface, however; many top-side towns were connected via underground transport tunnels and to the main planetary complex. The planet this first took place on, however, is now nothing more than large chunks of debris floating amongst the vacuum of space.",

    "The Nightars live in a similar manner as humans, though their advancements in technology allows them to eschew manual labor in favor of martial studies. The upper classes are almost exclusively made up of knights, assassins, or otherwise huntsmen. Their interactions with other species have produced largely mixed results.",

    "Some say they are hostile or otherwise detached, though this seems to stem from bandits and vagrants who have had bad run-ins with the Nightars. In truth, they are not much different from any other species; they too have those who are rather friendly with outsiders, while others are either indifferent or even hostile, though the hostilities tend to come from loyalists of the self-proclaimed ^cyan;Night King^reset;.",

    "Whatever the case may be, the Nightars themselves are something of an anomaly in terms of their genetic makeup, as well as given the fog surrounding their earliest history. There are many artifacts and relics from their early history that not even they themselves can explain. Perhaps, in time, we will come to understand just what exactly they are."
