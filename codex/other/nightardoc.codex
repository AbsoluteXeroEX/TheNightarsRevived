    //"The Nightars are a highly-intelligent, species that share their appearance with humans. they tend to live in castle-like structures and fight like medieval knights. Like humans, they originated on Earth, and later began to colonize other planets.",

    //"Their oldest known construction was a massive, planet-wide city that expanded mostly underground; though, this didn't stop some from living on the surface if they so chose. They live in a similar manner to humans, though their advancements in technology allows them to eschew manual labor in favor of matial studies; the upper classes are almost exclusively made up of knights or assassins.",

    //"Nightars tend to have cold, detached personalities, rarely socializing outside of their own social class and generally shying away from contact with other races, though they hold no particular affection or hostility towards them. Most Nightars prefer to live in the fortresses and castles common of their race amongst kin or servants, though some exiles or loners prefer the solitude of deserted or otherwise isolated places.",

    //"The Ruin's destruction of Earth and the countless lives lost evoked very little, if any, sorrow from the Nightars for the homeworld of their ancestors. It is said, however, that some nobles have taken great, private enjoyment of the Protectorate's sudden downfall; no doubt loyalists to the royal family who share their disdain for humans.",

	  //"As anti-social as they tend to be, the Nightars are not entirely unwelcoming to outsiders, whether it's just passing through or to do business, but woe to any who come to their dwellings with malicious intent; ^#3b5784;the darkness of night can hold many terrors^reset;."

    "No one remembers who exactly the first Nightar was; hardly any of them remember their origins at all. Time whisked away their oldest memories. It is likely that they are an evolution of humans, since they share an overall, nearly identical appearance with them.",

    "The oldest known construction was a massive, planet-wide city that expanded mostly underground. This didn't stop them from completely living on the surface, however; many top-side towns were connected via underground transport tunnels and to the main planetary complex. The planet this first took place on, however, is now nothing more than large chunks of debris floating amongst the vacuum of space.",

    "The Nightars live in a similar manner as humans, though their advancements in technology allows them to eschew manual labor in favor of martial studies. The upper classes are almost exclusively made up of knights, assassins, or otherwise huntsmen. Their interactions with other species have produced largely mixed results. Some say they are hostile or otherwise detached, though this seems to stem from bandits and vagrants who have had bad run-ins with the Nightars.",

    "In truth, they are not much different from any other species; they too have those who are rather friendly with outsiders, while others are either indifferent or even hostile, though the hostilities tend to come from loyalists of their self proclaimed ^cyan;Night King^reset;."
