    "Gin once again lashed out in anger, claiming that his brilliant mind wouldn't be wasted on cowardly societies. This prompted USCM forces to engage Gin, who was considerably outnumbered this time. He fled with his research team, periodically stopping to allow them more time to get ahead of their pursuers before catching back up to them.",
	
	"When they believed they had put enough distance between them and the USCM forces, they retreated back to their laboratory, where they began integrating the new engine into a previously-defunct vessel. As the engine was being brought online, a shot rang out and one of the researchers fell to the ground from a maintenance catwalk, blood now pooling beneath him.",
	
	"The USCM had tracked them down and had them pinned. The researchers decided to make a final stand. One researcher, a human female named 'Alesis', had taken it upon herself to act as Gin's bodyguard. Slowly but surely, the remaining researchers began losing ground, and those who acted as cover urged Gin and the others on the ship to go ahead and take off.",
	
	"Gin acknowledged them, saying their sacrifices would not be in vain. Gin himself was one of the last few to board the vessel just before it took off. Alesis was the last to get on board, but she was shot by one of the USCM soldiers; Gin managed to get her safely on board. Their vessel would be under heavy barrage up until leaving the planet's orbit.",
	
	"Once they were clear, they made the jump to a remote system outside of Earth's jurisdiction. Gin tended to Alesis' wounds, expressing his gratitude for her bravery, and she thanked him for stopping to help her. They both were infuriated by the treatment they had all received and the unknown fate of their colleagues left behind.",
	
	"Gin and the remainder of his team landed on a dark planet in the fringes of space. After landing, they began excavating the terrain and building a small settlement. Gin and Alesis grew closer together, and eventually swore themselves to each other. Gin's children bore the same traits as himself; snow-white hair and darker skin complexions, as well as enhanced physical strength."
