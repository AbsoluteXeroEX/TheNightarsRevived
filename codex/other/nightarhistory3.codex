    "After building their initial colony, Gin and the researchers detected a USCM prisoner transport vessel approaching their planet. Distraught, they armed themselves as best they could. When the vessel made its landing, they were expecting soldiers first. However, they were bewildered to see no one but prisoners stepping outside.",
	
	"The prisoners had spotted them, but rather than attacking, they sent a lone prisoner to act as an emissary for their party. The human emissary, who was called 'Albert', expressed that they had no intentions of wanting to take over, but rather asked if they could reside along Gin and the others.",
	
	"Gin expressed his reluctance, but was assured by Albert that they would not turn on him, with Albert even going as far as to swearing loyalty to him as a leader. Gin and Albert began discussing their plights, and came to a mutual understanding with each other. Afterwards, Albert and his crew began residing with Gin's settlement, offering to help maintain and improve the existing structures, and even build new ones.",
	
	"Over time, the once-small colony grew to a massive underground city, which marked the beginning of the Nightar Empire, and Gin was established as the effective ruler. This was the first known full-fledged instance of a Nightar settlement, which eventually grew into a vast empire. Gin Yorukishi I died peacefully in his sleep after reaching an astounding age of 131 years.",
	
	"Gin's firstborn, Gin Yorukishi II, became the next ruler, effectively crowned as king. His first proclamation was to resist any who set foot upon the planet whose intentions were malicious, but otherwise permitted contact with outsiders. He bore three sons, the youngest of which would become his successor, Gin Yorukishi III.",
	
	"Gin Yorukishi III was taught the history of the Nightars, and subsequently inherited his late grandfather's rage. Seeking to become an ultimate power, he assassinated his father and fought his two elder brothers after they discovered what had happened. Establishing himself as the new Night King, Gin Yorukishi III began an ambitious conquest that would drag the Nightars into a prolonged war."
