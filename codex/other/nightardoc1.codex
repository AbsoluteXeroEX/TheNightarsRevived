    "No one remembers who exactly the first Nightars were; hardly any of them remember their origins at all, as time whisked away their oldest memories. What IS known is that they closely resemble humans, have the tenacity of Florans, and are high-minded like the Apex. Truly, they are a culmination of many great things.",

    "The Nightars shun the light and embrace the shadows, though this appears to be more rooted in their overall biology. Like some humans have a sensitivity to sunlight, the Nightars become extremely lethargic and weakened when exposed to sunlight. This has led to a significant, cultural root, particularly where religion is concerned.",

    "Some of the more over-zealous Nightars shun any significant ceremonies, such as marriage, from being held during any night where the moon's light shines, as they believe it to be an ill omen signifying a major burden of weakness in their future.",

    "To add on to this, they look with disdain upon all creatures that dwell above the ground, be they beasts or sentient bipeds. This denotes a mostly xenophobic view in the larger settlements. Smaller settlements have broken away from the over-zealousness of what you could call the 'main branch'.",

    "These smaller settlements can be found anywhere underground and in larger alcoves that provide adequate shade from the sun (due to their inherent biology previously noted). Overall, the Nightars tend to keep to themselves, but they are not entirely unwelcoming; they are willing to do business with other sentient species if it suits them."
