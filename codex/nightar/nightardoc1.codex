    "No one remembers who exactly the first Nightars were; hardly any of them remember their origins at all, as time whisked away their oldest memories. What IS known is that they most closely resemble humans, have the tenacity of Florans, and are high-minded like the Apex. Truly, they are a culmination of many great things.",

    "The Nightars shun the light and embrace the shadows, seemingly brought on by their biology, for the most part. Like some humans have a sensitivity to sunlight, the Nightars become extremely lethargic exposed to sunlight. This has led to a large, cultural significance, particularly where religion is concerned.",

    "Some of the more zealous Nightars shun any significant ceremonies, such as marriage, from being held during any night where the moon's light shines, as they believe it to be a curse to haunt them and their offspring. They look with disdain upon all creatures that dwell above the ground, be they beasts or otherwise. This denotes a mostly xenophobic view in the larger settlements.",

    "Smaller settlements have broken away from the over-zealousness of what you could call the 'main branch'. These smaller settlements can be found anywhere underground, but also above ground in larger alcoves that provide adequate shade from the sun. While the majority of Nightars tend to keep to themselves, some of the smaller branches are not entirely unwelcoming; they are willing to do business with other people if it suits them."
