    "Our current king is Gin Yorukishi; the third of his name, and is known as the Night King. He has lead the Nightars for the last 2 decades. He became the king of the Nightars after his victory over his two elder brothers in combat. For years, he has defended Nightfort from every intruder, and spares no traitor. His authority is absolute; any who oppose the King will find themselves at the mercy of his blade."
